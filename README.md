PlantUML plugin, heavily borrowing from http://github.com/scrooloose/vim-slumlord, but geared towards my personal preferences.

Features:
* Automatically display ASCII-art version of *.uml file on save in the preview window
* Error display when there is invalid syntax
* UltiSnip snippets for some commonly used items.
